In 2006, several legal changes in the U.S. impacted alcohol and drug regulations, reflecting ongoing efforts to address public health and safety concerns. Some notable changes include:

1. **Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA) of 2005**:
   - Enacted in March 2006, the CMEA was part of the Patriot Act and aimed to limit the production of methamphetamine by regulating access to precursor chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine. 
   - It required products containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine to be sold behind the counter and imposed purchasing limits to reduce their use in illegal drug manufacturing.

2. **State-Level Alcohol Sales and Open Container Law Adjustments**:
   - Some states modified their alcohol sale hours or Sunday sales restrictions in response to changing public and business interests. For example, states like Georgia, which historically prohibited Sunday alcohol sales, saw legislative discussions around lifting these restrictions, although changes would vary by state.
   - Open container law adjustments occurred in some states to further prevent drinking while driving. These laws typically focused on limiting alcohol presence in vehicles to discourage drunk driving.

3. **Stricter DUI Penalties and Interlock Devices**:
   - Many states introduced harsher penalties for DUI/DWI offenses in 2006, including mandatory ignition interlock devices (IIDs) for repeat offenders. IIDs require the driver to pass a breathalyzer test before the vehicle will start, and they aim to reduce repeat DUI incidents.
   - Some states expanded these requirements to first-time offenders with high BAC levels (typically above 0.15%).

4. **Alcohol Advertising and Youth Exposure**:
   - In 2006, advocacy groups increased pressure on federal and state bodies to tighten regulations on alcohol advertising to prevent youth exposure. Though no sweeping federal changes were enacted, some states looked at placing stricter guidelines on where alcohol could be advertised, especially near schools and public venues frequented by minors.

5. **Increased Federal and State Focus on Prescription Drug Abuse**:
   - While this wasnâ€™t directly related to alcohol, the growing awareness of prescription drug abuse, especially opioid misuse, led states to start strengthening prescription monitoring programs (PMPs). PMPs aimed to track prescriptions of controlled substances, including opioids and benzodiazepines, to prevent misuse and reduce drug-related overdoses.

These legal shifts in 2006 reflected broader concerns about public safety and health, as well as the challenges of balancing accessibility with the prevention of substance misuse.
